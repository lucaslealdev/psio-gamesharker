# Gamesharker

Welcome to Gamesharker! This program aims to configure all the games on your TF used in PSIO to be multidisc, adding a GameShark you have on the card.

## Requirements

1. Set up the directory structure with each game in its own folder, including the GameShark folder.
1. Select the GameShark folder in the list.
